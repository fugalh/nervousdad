A contraction timer for the nervous dad-to-be.

Your wife is going into labor. Is it time to rush to the hospital or call the
midwife?

Fire up nervous dad and press any key when a contraction starts or ends. At
the beginning of a contraction, read the contraction period (time "between"
contractions) in the Period column. At the end of a contraction read the
length of the contraction in the Interval column. When the designated
frequency is reached, calmly put down the laptop and take action.
